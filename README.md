## Gameplay

In a 1vs1 traditional Snakes and Ladders board, each player starts with a token on the starting square. Players take turns rolling a single die to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die roll. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard. 

If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a "ladder", the player moves the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a "snake", the token must be moved down to the snake's lower-numbered square. 

In a new twist to this traditional setup we added special items: "axe" and "snakecharmer". Each player has an equal probability of getting these items throughout the game. The "axe" allows a player to stop the opponent from climbing the ladder and the "snakecharmer" allows the player to protect themselves from going down in case they encounter a snake. 

Apart from this players can use there own special items to counter there opponent's special items; incase they used it; to cancel there effects. The player who is first able to get their token out of the board is the winner.

## How To Start
